Esp32 light control for ws28xx light strings with web interface and OTA
I like to put on a bit of an outdoor light display at Christmas. It's becoming a boit of a thing for me to do it bigger and better every year. Enter the ubiquitous ESP-32 in combination with WS28xx type individually programmable light strings. 
This project attempts to create an easy to use web interface which enables you to configure the lights (speed, pattern...) and to create new patterns in a simple way. 
The device should support over the air (OTA) reimaging (firmware updates) as they will of necessity end up in hard to access locations where the need to connect a USB cable would be a pain.
